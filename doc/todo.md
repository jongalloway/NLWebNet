# TODO

This repo is a proof of concept ASP.NET Core implementation of the NLWeb standard / protocol as defined in <https://github.com/microsoft/NLWeb/>

## NLWeb Rest API

The REST API as copied from the source repo is as follows:

At this point, NLWeb supports 2 APIs at the endpoints /ask and /mcp. The arguments are the same for both, as is most of the functionality. The /mcp endpoint returns the answers in format that MCP clients can use. The /mcp endpoint also supports the core MCP methods (`list_tools`, `list_prompts`, `call_tool` and `get_prompt`).

In the included implementation, there is no server side state. So, the context of the conversation thus far has to be passed back as part of the request. As described below, there are multiple ways to do this.

The required argument to ask / mcp is:

- `query`: The current query in natural language

The following are optional arguments:

- `site`: A token corresponding to some subset of the data of a backend. For example, a backend might support multiple sites, each with a conversational interface restricted to its content. This parameter can be used to specify the site
- `prev`: comma separated list of previous queries. In most cases, the decontextualized query can be constructed from this.
- `decontextualized_query`: the entire decontextualized query. If this is available, no decontextualization is done on the server side
- `streaming`: defaults to true. To turn off streaming, specify a value of 0 or false
- `query_id`: if none is specified, one will be auto generated
- `mode`: values are list (default), summarize and generate
  - `list` : returns the list of top matches from the backend that are most relevant to the query
  - `summarize`: summarizes the list and presents the summary and also returns the list
  - `generate`: much more like traditional RAG, where the list is generated and one or more calls are made to an LLM to try answer the user's question.

The returned value is a json object with the following fields:

- `query_id`
- zero or more result attributes
- An array (soon to be moved to a richer structure, starting with schema.org's ItemList) of results, each of which has:
  - `url`
  - `name`
  - `site`
  - `score`
  - `description` (generated by an llm)
  - `schema_object` (the item, from the data store, encoded in json)

## Current Status

#### **BREAKTHROUGH FINDINGS**

**âœ… Extension Methods Working**: The NLWebNet package correctly exposes extension methods, but they are accessible via `using NLWebNet;` rather than `using NLWebNet.Extensions;`. This is actually the **correct and standard pattern** used by Microsoft.Extensions.* libraries.

**âœ… Package Structure Validated**: The package includes all necessary components:

- Core models and services in `NLWebNet` namespace
- Extension methods accessible from base namespace
- All dependencies properly resolved
- Framework references correctly configured

**âœ… Consumer Integration Success**: Test consumer project successfully:

- Installs NLWebNet package from local source
- Builds without errors using `using NLWebNet;`
- Extension methods `AddNLWebNet()` and `MapNLWebNet()` work correctly
- Application starts and runs successfully
  - [x] âœ… **VERIFIED**: All public APIs are accessible (core library + extensions)
  - [x] âœ… **CONFIRMED**: Extension method IntelliSense and compilation working
  - [x] âœ… **VALIDATED**: Minimal API endpoint registration works correctly
- [x] **Production Readiness**:
  - [x] âœ… **RESOLVED**: ModelContextProtocol prerelease dependency - NLWebNet marked as 0.1.0-alpha.1  - [x] âœ… **Final package validation before publication**:
    - [x] âœ… Run comprehensive validation script (`deployment/scripts/validate-package.ps1`) - ALL CHECKS PASSED
    - [x] âœ… Verify package content and assembly metadata - Confirmed correct structure
    - [x] âœ… Confirm no vulnerable or deprecated dependencies - Clean
    - [x] âœ… Test integration with fresh consumer project - Successful compilation
    - [x] âœ… Validate package size and optimization - 59.42 KB, reasonable size
    - [x] âœ… Check NuGet package validation tool results - Minor warnings only (non-blocking)
    - [x] âœ… Verify symbols package (.snupkg) generation - Package ready
    - [x] âœ… Confirm README.md and metadata inclusion - All metadata validated
    - [x] âœ… Fix CI versioning issue - Updated GitHub Actions workflow with proper version determination and validation
    - [x] âœ… Fix CI permissions issue - Added checks: write permissions and GITHUB_TOKEN for test-reporter action  - [x] âœ… **COMPLETED**: Update documentation with confirmed usage patterns
  - [x] âœ… **PUBLISHED**: NuGet package live at [nuget.org/packages/NLWebNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLWebNet/)

### Phase 11: Deployment & Production Readiness âœ…

#### Status: **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

- [x] **NuGet Package Production Features**:
  - [x] âœ… **PUBLISHED**: Live package on NuGet.org with version 0.1.0-alpha.2
  - [x] âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated build, test, validate, and publish workflow

  - [x] âœ… **Release Automation**: GitHub releases created with attached packages
  - [x] âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust fallback logic for validation issues

#### **ðŸš€ PRODUCTION MILESTONE ACHIEVED**

The NLWebNet library is now successfully deployed as a production-ready NuGet package with:

- **Live Package**: Available for installation via `dotnet add package NLWebNet`
- **Automated Publishing**: Tag-based releases automatically publish to NuGet.org
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with multiple validation stages
- **Developer Experience**: Full IntelliSense support and extension method accessibility
- [x] Demo app deployment:
  - [x] Docker containerization
  - [x] Azure App Service deployment configuration
  - [x] Azure Container Apps deployment configuration
  - [x] Kubernetes manifests (deployment, service, ingress, configmap)
  - [x] Environment-specific configurations
  - [x] Health check integration (already implemented)
  - [x] Container registry setup documentation

### Phase 11.5: GitHub Models Demo Integration âœ…

#### Status: **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Enhanced the demo application to provide seamless GitHub Models integration for users without AI provider setup:

- [x] **AI Provider Detection**: Created `AIConfigurationService` to detect when no AI provider is configured
- [x] **GitHub Models Client**: Implemented `GitHubModelsChatClient` with Microsoft.Extensions.AI compatibility  
- [x] **Token Input UI**: Built `GitHubTokenInput.razor` component with secure session-based token storage
- [x] **Demo Integration**: Updated `NLWebDemo.razor` to show GitHub token input when no AI is configured
- [x] **User Experience**: Added model selection, token validation, and comprehensive help documentation

**Key Benefits**: Users can instantly test real AI responses using GitHub Models without complex configuration setup, providing an excellent out-of-the-box demo experience.

### Open Questions to Resolve

**âœ… RESOLVED Questions:**

1. âœ… **Backend Data Source**: Implemented extensible `IDataBackend` interface with `MockDataBackend` for demo; users can implement custom backends
2. âœ… **LLM Integration**: Full Microsoft.Extensions.AI integration with support for Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, and other providers  
3. âœ… **Streaming Implementation**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation with proper headers and fallbacks
4. âœ… **NuGet Package Name**: "NLWebNet" successfully published and available
5. âœ… **Deployment Target**: Comprehensive deployment support (Docker, Kubernetes, Azure) with configuration examples

**Remaining Questions:**

1. **Authentication**: API currently has no authentication/authorization - this could be added as middleware
2. **Data Schema**: `schema_object` field format depends on specific backend implementation needs
3. **Production Data Sources**: Integration with real search engines, databases, or knowledge bases
