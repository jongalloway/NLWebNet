# Design Decisions and Open Questions

This document captures important design decisions made during NLWebNet development and open questions for future consideration.

## Resolved Design Decisions

### 1. Backend Data Source Architecture ✅
**Decision**: Implemented extensible `IDataBackend` interface with `MockDataBackend` for demo  
**Reasoning**: Allows users to implement custom backends while providing working demo functionality  
**Implementation**: Single backend interface that can be extended to multiple backends

### 2. LLM Integration Approach ✅
**Decision**: Full Microsoft.Extensions.AI integration  
**Reasoning**: Provides standardized AI client abstraction supporting multiple providers  
**Providers Supported**: Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, GitHub Models, and other Microsoft.Extensions.AI compatible providers

### 3. Streaming Implementation ✅  
**Decision**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation with proper headers and fallbacks  
**Reasoning**: Standard web streaming protocol with good browser support  
**Implementation**: Avoids C# yield-return-in-try-catch limitations through proper separation of concerns

### 4. NuGet Package Strategy ✅
**Decision**: "NLWebNet" package name following Microsoft.Extensions.* patterns  
**Reasoning**: Clear naming that indicates .NET implementation of NLWeb protocol  
**Status**: Successfully published and available at [nuget.org/packages/NLWebNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLWebNet/)

### 5. Deployment Architecture ✅
**Decision**: Comprehensive deployment support (Docker, Kubernetes, Azure)  
**Reasoning**: Flexibility for different production environments  
**Implementation**: Complete configuration examples and automation scripts

## Open Questions for Future Consideration

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**Current State**: API currently has no authentication/authorization  
**Considerations**:
- Should authentication be built into the core library or provided as middleware?
- What authentication patterns work best for NLWeb protocol implementations?
- How to balance security with ease of integration?

**Potential Approaches**:
- API key-based authentication middleware
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration
- Custom authentication provider interface
- Rate limiting per user/application

### 2. Data Schema Standardization
**Current State**: `schema_object` field format depends on specific backend implementation  
**Considerations**:
- Should NLWebNet provide standardized schema formats?
- How to balance flexibility with consistency?
- What are the most common data structure patterns?

**Potential Approaches**:
- Schema.org-based standardization
- JSON Schema validation
- Configurable schema transformation
- Backend-specific schema mapping

### 3. Production Data Sources
**Current State**: Demo uses mock data backend  
**Considerations**:
- Which real data sources should have first-class support?
- How to balance wide compatibility with deep integration?
- What are the most requested backend types?

**Potential Implementations**:
- Azure Cognitive Search backend
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch backend  
- Vector database integration (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- Database-backed search with Entity Framework
- File system and document indexing
- Web scraping and content extraction

### 4. Multi-Tenancy Support
**Current State**: Single-tenant focused  
**Considerations**:
- How to isolate data and configuration per tenant?
- What are the performance implications?
- How to handle tenant-specific customizations?

**Potential Approaches**:
- Tenant-aware data backends
- Configuration isolation
- Per-tenant caching strategies
- Tenant-specific AI model configurations

### 5. Advanced Caching Strategies
**Current State**: Minimal caching implementation  
**Considerations**:
- What should be cached (queries, results, embeddings)?
- How to handle cache invalidation?
- What are the performance vs. freshness trade-offs?

**Potential Implementations**:
- Redis-based result caching
- Embedding vector caching
- Query pattern caching
- Backend-aware caching strategies

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Extensibility First
All core interfaces (`IDataBackend`, `IQueryProcessor`, etc.) are designed for extension and customization while maintaining compatibility.

### 2. Configuration Over Code
Prefer configuration-based customization over code changes where possible, supporting multiple configuration formats (JSON, YAML, XML).

### 3. Microsoft Ecosystem Integration
Leverage Microsoft.Extensions.* patterns and libraries for consistency with .NET ecosystem expectations.

### 4. Performance and Scale Awareness
Design decisions consider performance implications, with support for streaming, async operations, and potential clustering.

### 5. Developer Experience Focus
Prioritize clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and helpful error messages for library consumers.
