## Required Update Issues

### Issue 1: Implement Multi-Backend Retrieval Architecture
**Labels**: `Required Update`, `enhancement`, `architecture`
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Large

**Description:**
The NLWeb June 2025 release requires support for multiple simultaneous backends. This is a breaking architectural change that needs immediate attention.

- [ ] Implement concurrent querying across multiple backends with automatic deduplication
- [ ] Add concept of primary "write endpoint" while reading from multiple sources
- [ ] Create configuration migration utilities

**Code Areas Affected:**
- `Services/IDataBackend.cs` - Interface needs extension or replacement
- `Services/NLWebService.cs` - Core service logic needs multi-backend support
- Configuration system - New YAML-style configuration support
- Demo application - Update for multi-backend scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Multiple backends can be configured simultaneously
- [ ] Queries execute in parallel across all enabled backends
- [ ] Results are deduplicated automatically
- [ ] One backend can be designated as "write endpoint"
- [ ] Existing single-backend configurations still work

### Issue 2: Implement Tool Selection Framework
**Labels**: `Required Update`, `enhancement`, `protocol`

The NLWeb June 2025 release introduces a tool selection framework that routes queries to appropriate tools based on intent.

**Current State:** No tool selection system exists.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Implement query routing to appropriate tools based on intent
- [ ] Add `tool_selection_enabled` configuration option
- [ ] Ensure existing queries work when tool selection is disabled
- [ ] Maintain existing behavior for `generate_mode` queries

**Code Areas Affected:**
- New `Services/IToolSelector.cs` interface
- `Services/QueryProcessor.cs` - Add tool selection logic
- `Models/NLWebRequest.cs` - May need additional parameters
- Configuration system - Add tool selection settings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tool selection engine routes queries to appropriate handlers
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained when tool selection is disabled
- [ ] Configuration option controls tool selection behavior
- [ ] Query processing performance impact < 20%

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Small

**Description:**
The NLWeb June 2025 release introduces new configuration formats including YAML-style multi-backend configuration and XML-based tool definitions.

**Current State:** Basic configuration through `NLWebOptions`.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Support new YAML-style configuration with `enabled` flags
- [ ] Support XML-based tool definitions
- [ ] Provide seamless upgrade from current configuration
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

**Code Areas Affected:**
- Configuration system
- `Models/NLWebOptions.cs`
- Demo application configuration
- Documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] YAML configuration format supported
- [ ] XML tool definitions can be loaded
- [ ] Existing JSON configuration still works
- [ ] Migration path documented

## Update Opportunity Issues

### Issue 4: Implement Advanced Tool System
**Labels**: `Update Opportunity`, `enhancement`, `feature`

**Effort**: Large

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive tool system including Search, Details, Compare, Ensemble, and Recipe tools for enhanced query capabilities.

**New Capabilities:**
- [ ] **Search Tool**: Enhanced keyword and semantic search
- [ ] **Details Tool**: Retrieve specific information about named items
- [ ] **Compare Tool**: Side-by-side comparison of two items
- [ ] **Ensemble Tool**: Create cohesive sets of related items
- [ ] **Recipe Tools**: Ingredient substitutions and accompaniment suggestions

**Implementation Strategy:**
- [ ] Create base `IToolHandler` interface
- [ ] Implement handlers for each tool type
- [ ] Add XML tool definition support
- [ ] Create tool selection algorithm based on query analysis

**Sample Queries to Support:**
- "Give me an appetizer, main and dessert for an Italian dinner"
- "I'm visiting Seattle for a day - suggest museums and nearby restaurants"
- "Plan a romantic date night with dinner and entertainment"
